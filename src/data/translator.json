Turns out my fist was a force to be reckoned with - those monsters fell to the ground before they could step on another potato! 'This young'un was born strong,' was what the village elders said, and I reckon this strength comes from my mama's side of the family. After this day I began to train under ol' 'Drunken Fist,' who they say was quite the somethin' in the old days of war (though I thought he was just an old drunkard before I started training). Anyway, I couldn't concentrate on my training since rumors spread of my fight with those two Goblins and three Ents, and our quiet town was bumblin' with people who thought they could fight - I couldn't take one step out of my hut without someone challenging me to a duel!

I asked myself, what can I do for my country? because I may not be much more than a country bumpkin but even a country bumpkin can fight for his king if he puts his mind to it! It was then that Lil' Buddy told us a rumor he had heard from the village down yonder. Seemed there had been some scuffling at the borders with the neighboring lands over some problem or other, and it was likely that the fight would blow up into war. Well, what better cause was there for me to use my years of training to do some good? I decided there and then that I would devote myself to the country I was born and raised and loved like my own mama. 'Goodbye,' I said to the people listening to Lil' Buddy's story, 'I reckon I can use my fists for some good there.' I didn't even bother packing and just headed straight for the borderlands, where I found out that Lil' Buddy's rumor had been true all along and war had begun. It was an interesting part of life, because you meet all sorts of people in war, you see. We won some battles and lost some too, but the records I kept still show that I won all the 300 duels I fought by myself. 'The Undefeated Fighter,' my comrades called me, and I gotta admit that made me feel pretty special - not just 'cause of the name but the fact that I could feel my comrades loved me as much as I loved them. Blessed souls, every one of them. So I fought for years and years, protecting the borders of our country, until a man from the Royal Court came looking for me. Wanted me to take me out of war and into the palace for some reason he wouldn't say, and I admit I was curious, but I refused if that meant I had to leave my comrades behind. So you can imagine my surprise when those very comrades came crowding around me and the man from the Royal Court. 'Shuwen, a man's gotta know his true calling when it comes for him.' Wise words from blessed souls. So I followed the man to the Royal Palace, where I shocked to discover that the king himself wanted to make me one of his Five Tiger Generals! Ain't that something! I thought to myself, well, this must be my true calling then, and I said yes, Your Majesty, all grand and important-like. You see, it wasn't just because of fame and honor that I accepted. A grand title means that you can do more things, it opens doors for a man to pursue greatness. And I was confident that I could do great things for my country and its people. But after some time I became a Tiger General, I found that not everyone thinks the same. Was pure tomfoolery, what they were doing at the Palace, and they sure didn't 'preciate a country bumpkin bumping shoulders with them. I went through some things a man shouldn't have to go through, not if he respects his fellow countrymen, but since that's another story I won't talk about it here. Anyway I left, because what's a grand title if you can't do great things with it? It was more disappointing as"

That's what I thought as I traveled the country after leaving the Palace, but I remembered ol' Drunken Fist's words and continued to train as often as I saw fit along the road. Then one day I had what some people call an enlightenment. Felt like a bright light suddenly going pop! in my head, and suddenly I saw answers to problems that had troubled me all these years, up to just the day before. The world seemed clear and simple. We humans only live once, but why were we fighting all the time? Weren't we happy enough just living in peace? Not just on the battlefield, but even among our countrymen we were hating each other and fighting until it seemed the world was gonna end. And the king! I have the greatest respect for His Majesty but during my time at the palace he showed his face just once, spending most of his time cooped up in his chambers like a sick rooster. Why should he worry his royal self to death when everything was so simple? So with my newfound wisdom I went back to the Palace, intent on telling His Majesty that he needn't worry all the time and could just stop the war if he put his mind to it. People along the way kept recognizing me and asked me where I had gone all this time. Said they'd thought I was dead or had gone mad somewhere. Well, I was impatient to see His Majesty and walked straight up to the Palace Doors without really answering - where a new face stopped my way. Turned out that my absence had been a little long and they had picked a new Tiger General to replace me, and this was the man. His name was Mengqi and he was young enough to be my son, if I had ever thought to get married! Master Hansung on the other hand was still there, his blind eyes seeing everything as always. I explained the whole situation to young Mengqi, who first refused to budge, but I reckon my words had some truth to them for he relented in time and let me in. Before the Palace Doors I thought it would be polite to knock, since I'm no longer a Tiger General and I had left without a word. So I knocked - and the doors suddenly toppled over as if they were made of paper! I was so flabbergasted and embarrassed that I just mumbled a few words and left. I admit, I was scared for a few days that I would be deemed a traitor for insulting the king or some reason of that sort. And why had the Palace Doors been so weak? Don't they build palaces to be sturdier than that? I came out after a few days, telling myself that a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do. Imagine my surprise when people began calling me the 'Fist King' and celebrating my strength! And that's the story of how I began to be called 'Fist King.'

Unlike her predators, Ranno has no hard teeth or sharp claws to boast of, but she is able to make useful tools that greatly aid her survival. Ranno so hides from the keen eyes of monsters and lives on small animals and fish caught with her traps. One day, Ranno stumbles upon a wounded young dinosaur.

When he starts regarding Ranno as his new mother and following her around everywhere, Ranno names the dinosaur 'Rex.' However, it soon turns out that Rex never learned how to hunt from his birth mother, and Ranno's meals are not enough for a growing dinosaur, no matter how much she hunts in a day. After some contemplation, Ranno climbs onto Rex's back with her fishing rod, with which she dangles a big chunk of meat before Rex's eyes. The hungry Rex starts chasing after the meat before him, gnashing his teeth. The dinosaur so begins to 'hunt' as his consciously chomping jaws sometimes luckily land on unsuspecting prey under Ranno's guidance, even without his realizing it."
