It is not such a bad deal for her family, or the mercenaries themselves: if she dies, there will be one less mouth to feed, and if she returns alive, they will profit in either money or the spoils of war. The strong warriors of Nosgard may boast and laugh of glorious feats and honor in battle, but such ideals are nothing more than pure luxury for Ran, for whom war only means a grim encounter with death. Instead, Ran chooses to fight by melting into the shadows and cutting the throats of her enemies under the veil of the dark. The other warriors criticize Ran for her 'cowardice,' calling her an embarrassment, but the one who laughs last laughs the longest: Ran, decades later, remains the sole survivor of countless battles.",

At times, she fights back humans from ‘stealing’ any of the bountiful salmon. Although she suffers injuries big and small in the process, Bera does not mind the arduous labor. If it means she can hold intelligent conversations with her temporarily smarter comrades every autumn, short as the blessing may last - then her pain is certainly worth it.",

Scouting her surroundings, the perplexed bear soon discovers the reason of the shortage: a nefarious monster of a machine invented by ‘Beron,’ a loner who has always distanced himself from the rest of the pack. Bera, furious that Beron would hog all the salmon for his selfish wish of keeping his intelligence forever, charges at the other bear. Beron reveals himself to be no easy match, however, equipped as he is with the advanced technology of Neth Empire. Bera has no choice but to retreat for the time being… but she still succeeds in breaking into Beron’s warehouse and stealing piles of salmon for her bear-kin. From that day on, the two bears become sworn enemies, and it is said that they fight a bloody battle every year on the banks of the Nosgard River.",

The ice on which the kingdom rests cracks under the pressure, and tumultuous waves engulf the penguins through the cracks. Queen Orca, her penguin subjects, and Steamers sink into the frigid waters below, and after the earthquake stills, only a few penguins remain by Olga's side. Following a voice inside her head, Olga leads the surviving penguins to the sea and collects the remaining Steamer devices. Just then, an alien creature pops up from the waters and onto the ice. After observing the creature's mighty stomps breaking the ice and causing the ground to shake, Olga mistakenly comes to identify it as the cause of her kingdom's destruction. An uncontrollable rage consumes her, and Olga commands her penguins to chase after the creature: the bane of her people and undoer of her mighty plans.",

It was then those monsters came trampling over our hard work, two Goblins and three Ents, and was I surprised to see them just charging forth like bulls before red! But I told myself, well Shuwen if you were born a man then you hafta act like one before you're dead and regretting you never did, so I summoned up all the courage I had and faced them straight. Turns out my fist was a force to be reckoned with - those monsters fell to the ground before they could step on another potato! 'This young'un was born strong,' was what the village elders said, and I reckon this strength comes from my mama's side of the family. After this day I began to train under ol' 'Drunken Fist,' who they say was quite the somethin' in the old days of war (though I thought he was just an old drunkard before I started training). Anyway, I couldn't concentrate on my training since rumors spread of my fight with those two Goblins and three Ents, and our quiet town was bumblin' with people who thought they could fight - I couldn't take one step out of my hut without someone challenging me to a duel! One of them was the sole descendant of a famous clan - we became good friends after this and that happened but this is a story for another time. But those challengers were more bark than bite and everyone fell to one punch of my fist - I was a little sorry because they had traveled all this way to our village and they didn't stay long after they lost, even when everyone offered a good hot meal that wouldn't have gone to waste, no sir.

        "text": "I thought that I had done some good with my training under ol' 'Drunken Fist,' and it seemed my fist was ready to do something in the world. I asked myself, what can I do for my country? because I may not be much more than a country bumpkin but even a country bumpkin can fight for his king if he puts his mind to it! It was then that Lil' Buddy told us a rumor he had heard from the village down yonder. Seemed there had been some scuffling at the borders with the neighboring lands over some problem or other, and it was likely that the fight would blow up into war. Well, what better cause was there for me to use my years of training to do some good? I decided there and then that I would devote myself to the country I was born and raised and loved like my own mama. 'Goodbye,' I said to the people listening to Lil' Buddy's story, 'I reckon I can use my fists for some good there.' I didn't even bother packing and just headed straight for the borderlands, where I found out that Lil' Buddy's rumor had been true all along and war had begun. It was an interesting part of life, because you meet all sorts of people in war, you see. We won some battles and lost some too, but the records I kept still show that I won all the 300 duels I fought by myself. 'The Undefeated Fighter,' my comrades called me, and I gotta admit that made me feel pretty special - not just 'cause of the name but the fact that I could feel my comrades loved me as much as I loved them. Blessed souls, every one of them. So I fought for years and years, protecting the borders of our country, until a man from the Royal Court came looking for me. Wanted me to take me out of war and into the palace for some reason he wouldn't say, and I admit I was curious, but I refused if that meant I had to leave my comrades behind. So you can imagine my surprise when those very comrades came crowding around me and the man from the Royal Court. 'Shuwen, a man's gotta know his true calling when it comes for him.' Wise words from blessed souls. So I followed the man to the Royal Palace, where I shocked to discover that the king himself wanted to make me one of his Five Tiger Generals! Ain't that something! I thought to myself, well, this must be my true calling then, and I said yes, Your Majesty, all grand and important-like. You see, it wasn't just because of fame and honor that I accepted. A grand title means that you can do more things, it opens doors for a man to pursue greatness. And I was confident that I could do great things for my country and its people. But after some time I became a Tiger General, I found that not everyone thinks the same. Was pure tomfoolery, what they were doing at the Palace, and they sure didn't 'preciate a country bumpkin bumping shoulders with them. I went through some things a man shouldn't have to go through, not if he respects his fellow countrymen, but since that's another story I won't talk about it here. Anyway I left, because what's a grand title if you can't do great things with it? It was more disappointing as",

That's what I thought as I traveled the country after leaving the Palace, but I remembered ol' Drunken Fist's words and continued to train as often as I saw fit along the road. Then one day I had what some people call an enlightenment. Felt like a bright light suddenly going pop! in my head, and suddenly I saw answers to problems that had troubled me all these years, up to just the day before. The world seemed clear and simple. We humans only live once, but why were we fighting all the time? Weren't we happy enough just living in peace? Not just on the battlefield, but even among our countrymen we were hating each other and fighting until it seemed the world was gonna end. And the king! I have the greatest respect for His Majesty but during my time at the palace he showed his face just once, spending most of his time cooped up in his chambers like a sick rooster. Why should he worry his royal self to death when everything was so simple? So with my newfound wisdom I went back to the Palace, intent on telling His Majesty that he needn't worry all the time and could just stop the war if he put his mind to it. People along the way kept recognizing me and asked me where I had gone all this time. Said they'd thought I was dead or had gone mad somewhere. Well, I was impatient to see His Majesty and walked straight up to the Palace Doors without really answering - where a new face stopped my way. Turned out that my absence had been a little long and they had picked a new Tiger General to replace me, and this was the man. His name was Mengqi and he was young enough to be my son, if I had ever thought to get married! Master Hansheng on the other hand was still there, his blind eyes seeing everything as always. I explained the whole situation to young Mengqi, who first refused to budge, but I reckon my words had some truth to them for he relented in time and let me in. Before the Palace Doors I thought it would be polite to knock, since I'm no longer a Tiger General and I had left without a word. So I knocked - and the doors suddenly toppled over as if they were made of paper! I was so flabbergasted and embarrassed that I just mumbled a few words and left. I admit, I was scared for a few days that I would be deemed a traitor for insulting the king or some reason of that sort. And why had the Palace Doors been so weak? Don't they build palaces to be sturdier than that? I came out after a few days, telling myself that a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do. Imagine my surprise when people began calling me the 'Fist King' and celebrating my strength! And that's the story of how I began to be called 'Fist King.' It's an embarrassing story, but you know it now. But now I 'spose I gotta tell you about my friend - remember that sole descendant of the famous clan I told you about?

The other Guardian Spirits too come to fear or despise the human race, and the once joyful Forest of Spirits withers away in silence and solitude. Years pass, until a cheerful melody resounds from beyond the forest. Neulsolgil and the other Guardian Spirits initially try to ignore the music, believing that it could be another attempt at invasion. Yet the power of music proves too strong after such a long period of silence, and the spirits find themselves unable to resist their curiosity. They run out of the forest to find the pungmul party that had once deceived them, as well as other humans from the local villages. The humans were asking the spirits for their forgiveness; they regretfully recount how the darkness that had overclouded the entire kingdom had also driven them to greed and violence. Neulsolgil gazes at them quietly. She steps forward... and begins to dance. The humans and the spirits smile, first among themselves, then at each other. Time may pass and history may take its course, but human and spirit alike will always remember the ensuing celebration of forgiveness and friendship that did not stop for ten days.",

The clearly uninterested Goddess, however, only glances at the stunned girl before snapping her fingers. Before her last echoes of pain ebb away, Nari is once more flung into the air and across the dimensions—straight into the middle of a battlefield of a strange new world.

Any confusion dissipates as Nari recognizes the Goddess and throws a punch in her direction, mustering all the enraged energy she has built up through decades of her training.

Maybe regaining mastery over her strength and 'ki' may help her return to Korea - who knows?

Instead, she declares that she will continue to research the 'celestial magic' that she developed with Loviatar's help, and teach young witches whose talents do not completely fit in with the four established fields of magic. Thus Estelle, now respectfully called 'the Witch of Stars,' becomes the newest and one of the most beloved professors at the Magic Academy.",

One day, a voice seeps out from within the volume. The voice whispers that it had been captured by Ethereals and tortured for years in their hands - and begs Shu Gwi to free it from its chains. Shu Gwi, for the first time in years, feels a sliver of empathy to the voice, drawn by its echoing loneliness and hunger.

However, only a few hours pass before the same flowers lose their bright colors - and this time, the entire forest begins to wither. Éfendére refuses to accept the limitations of her abilities and, in a desperate attempt, uses the last remaining energy of the earth to restore her forest to perfection.

After the birth of the new Hera, Medea begins to dedicate all her waking hours to investigating the rings of the Olympian Council: their true purpose, their powers, the reason behind the Council’s long tradition of handing them down across generations… As time passes, the priestess’s mind, once burning brightly with keen intelligence and purpose, narrows down to a festering obsession that knows no bounds.

I personally believe that it’s important to know what kind of person your comrade is if you want to have a good workplace relationship. You agree with me, don’t you? I told you my name, now what else… At four stars I am fifteen years old. Oh, did I just say ‘four stars’? Please forget I ever said anything of the sort! Must have been out of my mind just now. I was specifically asked not to make any ‘meta-statements’ but I forgot for a moment back there. You know, breaking the fourth wall kind of thing? Anyway… Uh, and… My hobby is running, my favorite food is grilled chicken, and I don’t particularly dislike anything. I’m a simple kind of man, doesn’t take a lot to satisfy me. Favorite color blue, haven’t taken the MBTI test, and my motto is to be clear and concise and say only what needs to be said! There are some people who tell me I talk too much, but that can’t be true. I’m careful to say only what I need to. Never gossiped in my entire life. Sincerity is the most important thing to a man if he wishes to make a place for himself in the world and find friends who will last a lifetime. Sincere is how I treat my challengers when they come searching for a fight, too. Oh, I should have told you earlier that my specialty is martial arts. I don’t want to be vain but I’ve been known for my strength ever since I was a teeny lad in a countryside village, and I was in charge of dealing with the invading monsters which I did without much trouble. That led to me meeting ol’ Drunken Fist and training under him – Drunken Fist was the local drunkard but he was also a great fighter… And well as you’ve already signed my contract, I’ll see you soon in my ‘story menu’!

And like those mushrooms, Loviatar is unfazed by external factors and patiently continues to do the things that she must do. As she does not need to sleep, the witch has been using the extra hours to organize the results of her research into a book on earth magic. The resulting work, 'An Elementary Guide to Elemental Magic,' remains decades later a must-read classic for even wizards attuned to other elementals.",

Lacrimoso visited the village to take care of Livea, still unconscious. Initially wary of Lacrimoso's foreign looks, the villagers started to open up to his healing powers and personality, finally accepting him as one of their own in just a few days. Lacrimoso was finally happy. His past self, not in his memories anymore, would have wanted this peaceful life anyhow with others' kindness and trust earned. He was only worried about Livea still being unconscious. Moved by sadness of Lacrimoso weeping at her side every day, the villagers put all matters aside and searched everywhere in Valencia for a way to awaken Livea. The peculiar rumors of the village finally reached the royal palace, and the King of Valencia came to visit the village to see the truth for himself.",

During her long years of reclusion, the Demon Realm was perhaps growing this charming flower of paradise. Asmodeus' eyes were irresistibly fixed on the boy, and her tactless heart was beating hard as if it would devour her. His slightly jaded yet sorrowed eyes, his two rosy and soft cheeks, and his delicate hands turning the pages. All of them came to her at an indescribable wavelength. Until he left, she could not move an inch as if bound at her feet. What was it that he was looking into with so much interest? Unable to suppress her curiosity, she found a pamphlet for a performance from a Succubus troupe. The title was \"The Magical Girl Chronicles\".",
